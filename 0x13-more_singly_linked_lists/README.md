## Singly Linked List
A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a collection of nodes, each of which contains data and a pointer to the next node in the list. The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node is called the tail.

# Operations on Singly Linked Lists
The following are some of the most common operations on singly linked lists:

`Insertion`: Inserting a new node into the list.
`Deletion`: Deleting a node from the list.
`Searching`: Searching for a node in the list.
`Traversal`: Traversing the list, visiting each node in turn.
