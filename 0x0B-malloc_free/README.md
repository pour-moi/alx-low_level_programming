# Malloc Project

This project is a C program that demonstrates the use of the `malloc` function to dynamically allocate memory.

## Overview

The `malloc` function is used to allocate a block of memory on the heap. The function takes a single argument, which is the size of the memory block to be allocated in bytes. The function returns a pointer to the allocated memory, or `NULL` if the allocation fails.

In this project, we use the `malloc` function to allocate memory for an array of integers. The user can specify the size of the array at runtime, and the program will allocate the necessary memory and initialize the array with some values.
